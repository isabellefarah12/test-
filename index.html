<h1><strong>Resume</strong></h1>
<h2>Isabelle Farah</h2>

<p><strong>Bio</strong>
I am interested in attending a university/college where I will
be able to pursue a degree in Film and Communications so that I
can incorporate my creativity and love of videography into whatever
career I ultimately choose.  From the moment I got my first smartphone at
age 13 I instinctively developed an interest in creating short videos just for fun.
It’s something I still do today and without much “formal training” I have created eleven
5-7 minute video blogs (vlogs) on a range of topics: a documentary about the lack
of guardrails along the canals in my neighborhood, and several other video skits.
I was a part of the team that represented NSU at a national film convention in Nashville
recently – a great experience.
