    <p>Luxury high-end retail brands are at the top end of the clothing industry.
      These are status symbol brands, made in very limited quantities and not typically found online immediately
      after a collection launches.  Sold through flagship stores and luxury boutiques worldwide, these are articles
      that are sometimes right off the runways -- the same styles that are worn by models in Milan, Barcelona, and London.
      Sometimes impractical, often exciting, always expensive, these are the seasonal collections that are meticulously
      conceived by world-renown fashion designers -- Versace, Prada, Armani, and many more.  It's important to note that
      many of these luxury brands have different tiers of collections - the main luxury line typically stands apart from the
      bridge lines and diffusion lines that may also share the brand name.  For example, "AX | Armani Exchange".</p>

      <img src="images/hermes.jpeg" width="600" height="350" alt="Hermes">
      <p>Fashion Designer Fashion Designer Thierry Hermes founded his saddlery company in 1837. His family were originally
        Protestants from Germany who settled in Paris around 1828. Gradually he added boots, jewelry, home decor items, and silk
        scarves. His son Charles-Emile Hermes (1835-1919) and grandsons Adolphe Hermes and Emile-Maurice (1870-1951) continued to
        run the family firm after Thierry died. Emile-Maurice Hermes, Theirry’s successor, realized at the turn of the 20th century
        that travel was fast moving away from the horse and towards plane, car, and train travel. He responded by manufacturing trunks,
        bags, overnight cases, all from his family’s signature saddle leather. He also purchased the building at 24 Rue Faubourg
        St.-Honoré in Paris, which still houses the flagship store as well as the workshops.</p>

        regular customer. In 1905, Alfonso XIII granted them the Royal Warrant of Appointment and thus Loewe became Purveyor of the Royal Household of Spain. The company

         which mirrored the effects produced by Op Art. Desiring to make his fashion more accessible, Rabanne launched a series of paper dresses in 1967. The soft, lightweight

        herself as a fixture of Paris’ ready-to-wear week. Her laid back aesthetic is littered with rock girl references, tactile fabrics and a Parisian’s attitude to silhouette:
        long and lean or louche and short. Marant’s designs both her main collection and her diffusion line, Isabel Marant Étoile, which are both sold all over the world. The brand
        also has nearly 40 directly-owned boutiques globally and an e-commerce site. However, the designer told W she approached own store expansion with caution, “When you have too
