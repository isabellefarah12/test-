        <h3>About</h3>
        <p><strong>Paris</strong> is formally known as the City of Light, less formally as the city of love,
          and, for those who are sartorially inclined, the capital of the fashion industry. It is home to some
          of the biggest luxury labels with the most prolific designers who create collections that are directional,
          reflective of the times, and, simply put, make us dream. From Christian Dior to Louis Vuitton, follow our
          reverie of the best of Paris Fashion Week fall 2020."

          Even though they are often used together, the term fashion differs from clothes and costume, where the first
          describes the material and technical garment, whereas the second has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress
          or masquerade wear. Fashion instead describes the social and temporal system that "activates" dress as a social signifier
          in a certain time and context. Philosopher Giorgio Agamben connects fashion to the current intensity of the qualitative moment,
          to the temporal aspect the Greek called kairos, whereas clothes belong to the quantitative, to what the Greek called chronos.
          Exclusive brands aspire for the label haute couture, but the term is technically limited to members of the Chambre Syndicale
          de la Haute Couture in Paris.</p>
