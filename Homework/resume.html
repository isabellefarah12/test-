  <strong>Bio</strong>
    I am interested in attending a university/college where I will
    be able to pursue a degree in Film and Communications so that I
    can incorporate my creativity and love of videography into whatever
    career I ultimately choose.  From the moment I got my first smartphone at
    age 13 I instinctively developed an interest in creating short videos just for fun.
    It’s something I still do today and without much “formal training” I have created eleven
    5-7 minute video blogs (vlogs) on a range of topics: a documentary about the lack
    of guardrails along the canals in my neighborhood, and several other video skits.
    I was a part of the team that represented NSU at a national film convention in Nashville
    recently – a great experience.
