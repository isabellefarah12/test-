    <div class="tips"><h3>1. Go out of season</h3></div>
    <p>While it’s true that parts of Portugal – Lisbon and the Algarve beaches in particular – can be overcrowded and busy in high summer,
      they are surprisingly quiet out of season. Autumn is a lovely time to visit – the sea is at its warmest (the Algarve average water
      temperature in October is 21˚C) while the sun still shines for an average of seven hours a day. Most Portuguese assert that the sea
      is far too cold outside the self-imposed “swimming season” (usually just July and August), leaving the beaches more or less empty in
      the shoulder seasons.</p>

      <div class="tips"><h3>2. Venture off the beaten track</h3></div>
      <p>In Portugal it pays to get off the tourist trail. Head inland to the border region, where fortified castle towns such as Marvão
        and Estremoz loom over the surrounding plains, and storks nest in spring above the olive and orange groves. In autumn, go north
        to the Douro vineyards, where the vines are bursting with grapes – you can even join in with the harvest and grape-stomping at
        some wine estates. If you just want some sun and swimming, head to the coasts of the Alentejo, the Centro district or the west
        coast of the Algarve, where the long sandy beaches are still relatively undeveloped.</p>

      <div class="tips"><h3>3. Eat and drink like the locals</h3></div>
      <p>Portuguese food and drinks are usually excellent quality and very good value, so stick to ordering what is grown, caught or made
        locally. You’ll find a fine array of fresh fish and seafood everywhere, while Portuguese pork and local cheeses are hugely underrated.
        The local house wine will almost certainly be excellent. Local beers and spirits will cost around half the price (and taste pretty
         much the same) as the branded international equivalents.</p>

      <div class="tips"><h3>4. Be prepared to walk</h3></div>
      <p>The Portuguese can be very reluctant to venture far from their vehicles, which is why you’ll see often a roadside lay-by full of
        families picnicking next to their cars. So, you don’t have to walk very far up a track or away from the car park to have the beach,
        woodland or beauty spot completely to yourself. </p>

      <div class="tips"><h3>5. Don’t assume the starters are free</h3></div>
      <p>Most Portuguese restaurants will bring you a selection of starters to enjoy while you peruse the menu. These can be as simple as a
        bowl of olives, a basket of bread with butter, local cheeses, tuna or sardine paste, though smarter restaurants may serve prawns,
        crab paté, a variety of sausages, or even a selection of seafood. Don’t assume that these are free – anything you eat will be added
        to your bill. Some menus show a cover charge per person which usually includes bread and butter, others will charge for everything
        individually, even the bread rolls. But don’t get too hung up on this – usually the simple starters are pretty cheap, so if you fancy
        some bread and cheese to start, go for it. Just be aware that anything fishy is usually expensive so only tuck in if you really want it.
        And don’t be afraid to check the price of anything, and say “no thanks” to the waiter if they bring you dishes you don’t want. </p>
