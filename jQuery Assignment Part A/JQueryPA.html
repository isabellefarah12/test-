    <h2>Portugal</h2>
      <p><p><strong>Origins:</strong> Portugal is a southern European country on the
        Iberian Peninsula, bordering Spain. Its location on the Atlantic Ocean has
        influenced many aspects of its culture: salt cod and grilled sardines are national
        dishes, the Algarve's beaches are a major destination and much of the nation’s architecture
        dates to the 1500s–1800s, when Portugal had a powerful maritime empire. Portugal has
        ts own language, the 6th most spoken in the world (think Brazil-Portugal’s former colony), its
        own culture and cuisine. Portugal’s shape is rectangular, the longest north-south distance is
        349 miles/561 km and widest east-west distance is 135 miles/218 km. It’s roughly the size of the
        U.S. state of Indiana. the country’s modest dimensions make it easy to visit when time is short.
        Portugal is divided into regions, each offers unique features , history, scenery and cuisine. The
        regions are from south to north: Algarve, Alentejo, Lisbon and Lisbon Coast, Estremadura and Ribatejo,
        the Beiras, Douro and Tras-os-Montes and the Minho.</p>

      <div class= "details">
        <p>From the north of Portugal, comes Caldo Verde, the famous Portuguese soup. This is one of the most popular
          soups and Portuguese dishes. While Caldo Verde soup is particularly popular in the winter, you can enjoy it
          all year round, whether it is warm or cold outside. The soup is green in color and made with a particular dark
          green cabbage that is not widely available beyond Portugal’s borders. Substitutes include collard greens or kale.
          Wonderful flavors from the combination of potato puree, slices of chouriço sausage and local Portuguese olive oil,
          complete this delicious and hearty soup. We enjoyed Caldo Verde on several occasions. The soup is simple, full of
          flavor and with delicious textures. If you want to make this soup at home, this simple Caldo Verde recipe will have
          you tasting Portugal in no time.</p>

          <h3>2. Bacalhau or Portuguese Cod Fish – A Treasured Portuguese Food</h3>
          <div class= "details">
                 <p>Bacalhau or Portuguese codfish is a national obsession. In Portugal, there are over 365 ways of preparing bacalhau –
                 one for each day of the year. You’ll find Portuguese codfish prepared in many different ways. From grilled, baked, canned,
                 and fried you’ll easily find your eating pleasure. Our favorite codfish preparation is the Bacalhau à brás. This is a codfish
                 and egg scramble that is very popular. It is made with thin strips of codfish mixed together with potatoes, eggs, onions, garlic
                 and olives and topped with chopped parsley.Simple and uncomplicated, this is one of the most typical Portuguese dishes not to miss
                 in Portugal.</p>

                  <h3>3. Sardines – Celebrated Portuguese Seafood Dishes</h3>
                  <div class= "details">
                    <p>Grilled Portuguese sardines or sardinhas asadas is the summertime food of choice in Portugal. In June, the smell of grilled
                      sardines infuse the streets of Lisbon for the whole month. That’s when Lisbon hosts the most popular festival dedicated to
                      sardines. The Day of Saint Anthony or Santo António Festival celebrates grilled Portuguese sardines on June 12th and 13th.
                      From there, the Festas de Sardinha season all other Portugal kicks off, where sardines are celebrated at several Summer
                      festivals.Where does the sardine popularity come from? Historically, the Portuguese with the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean
                      have relied heavily on seafood for food and commerce. The best time to eat fresh Portuguese sardines is during the peak season between June and
                      August. When fresh, sardines are eaten directly from the charcoal grill, marinated with Portuguese olive oil and served with
                      salads, rice or potatoes. Simply delicious, this Portuguese dish is a feast for the taste buds.</p>

                <h3>4. Bifanas – The National Portuguese Sandwich</h3>
                <div class= "details">
                      <p>Bifanas are traditional Portuguese pork sandwiches, so popular that you’ll find them everywhere in the country.These
                        Portuguese sandwiches are made of succulent marinated pork served in crunchy white bread. The marinade is made with spices
                        including paprika, garlic, and white wine. The bread has a crunchy crust on the outside while being soft on the inside.
                        Bifanas can be served with a bowl of soup and fries for a full meal at lunch or dinner time. Or served with beer, for a typical
                        late night Portuguese snack. There are several variations of the bifanas Portugal sandwiches. You can add more ingredients to
                        your sandwich such as eggs, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes or stick with the traditional one. Each eatery that makes bifanas will
                        have their own secret recipe for the marinade</p>

                      <h3>5. Francesinha Sandwich – The Famous Portuguese Food from Porto</h3>
                      <div class= "details">
                        <p>The Francesinha sandwich is an impressive plated sandwich that will make your “heart sing”. Very popular in Porto, you
                          will see it on almost every menu. Made with bread, ham, sausages, and steak, the sandwich is typically covered with melted
                          cheese and an egg on top. What makes the francesinha unique is the secret sauce that each restaurant prepares in its own
                          special way. The sauce is typically is a hot thick tomato and beer sauce used to dip or “flood” your sandwich. And the best
                          part is that you can ask for more as needed, for no additional cost. Francesinha literally means “little French girl.” It
                          is said to have been brought to Porto by an immigrant returning back from France. This sandwich is an adaptation of the French toasted sandwich, croque-monsieur.</p>

          <h3>2. Porto</h3>
          <div class= "details">
             <p>As it is the home of port, it is somewhat a given that you should try this sweet yet potent alcohol when visiting the city in
              northern Portugal. Porto is a picturesque place with vibrant colored buildings overlooking the Douro River and the famous white
              and blue tiles that are so associated with the country are scattered around the city. The numerous hills are dotted with medieval
              palaces, cathedrals, churches and more and simply wandering around Porto is a delight in itself. Head to the old center of Ribeira
              for its lively atmosphere, narrow twisting alleys and views over the river.</p>
          <div class= "pics">  <img src="images/porto.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Hermes"></div>
          </div>

              <img src="images/sintra.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Hermes"></div>
             <p>Almost fairytale-like in terms of what is on offer, Sintra has domineering castles, elegant palaces, luxurious villas and royal
               residences that will entice and astound visitors to this beautiful part of the country. The undoubted highlight is the jaw dropping
               Pena Palace which is bewitching in its uniqueness. Nestled among a tree-filled hilltop, the bright yellow building looks as if it
               appeared out of a Disney film, such is its eccentricity and distinctive architectural style. The nearby Moorish Castle is another
               fantastic place to visit as are the picturesque mountains that surround the area.</p></div>

          <h3>4. Aveiro</h3>
          <div class= "details">
            <p>With its network of canals, footbridges and colorfully painted boats, it is perhaps unsurprising that Aveiro has been nicknamed
              the ´Venice of Portugal´. Situated on the Atlantic coast, many people flock here for the picturesque beaches that lie just outside
              the city and the accompanying watersports on offer. Aveiro itself has more than enough attractions to keep people occupied with the
              most popular being the impressive Aveiro Cathedral and the ornately decorated Convento de Jesus. Head to Bairro Antigo for some delicious
              local cuisine.</p>  <div class= "pics">

              <img src="images/braga.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Hermes"></div>
             <p>Seamlessly mixing the old with the new, the different sides to Braga make it a fascinating place to stop by. The highlight for many
               is the incredible Bom Jesus do Monte; looking up at it from the bottom of an almost endless flight of steps, the cathedral at the top
                looks majestic. After a breathless ascent, there is a lovely view of the surrounding area. The historic center of the city is also
                great to visit and there are numerous churches and museums to pique your interest. The spectacular cathedral dates back almost a
                thousand years and, coupled with the new modern developments and spread out university campuses; it perfectly presents the different
                faces of the city.

          <h2>Top 5 Tips</h2>

          <h3>1. Go out of season</h3>
          <p>While it’s true that parts of Portugal – Lisbon and the Algarve beaches in particular – can be overcrowded and busy in high summer,
            they are surprisingly quiet out of season. Autumn is a lovely time to visit – the sea is at its warmest (the Algarve average water
            temperature in October is 21˚C) while the sun still shines for an average of seven hours a day. Most Portuguese assert that the sea
            is far too cold outside the self-imposed “swimming season” (usually just July and August), leaving the beaches more or less empty in
            the shoulder seasons.</p>
            <div class="pics">
            <img src="images/beach.jpg" width=600 height="400" alt="CaloVerde"></div>

           <h3>2. Venture off the beaten track</h3>
            <p>In Portugal it pays to get off the tourist trail. Head inland to the border region, where fortified castle towns such as Marvão
              and Estremoz loom over the surrounding plains, and storks nest in spring above the olive and orange groves. In autumn, go north
              to the Douro vineyards, where the vines are bursting with grapes – you can even join in with the harvest and grape-stomping at
              some wine estates. If you just want some sun and swimming, head to the coasts of the Alentejo, the Centro district or the west
              coast of the Algarve, where the long sandy beaches are still relatively undeveloped.</p>
              <div class="pics">
              <img src="images/valley.jpg" width=600 height="400" alt="CaloVerde"></div>


            <h3>3. Eat and drink like the locals</h3>
            <p>Portuguese food and drinks are usually excellent quality and very good value, so stick to ordering what is grown, caught or made
              locally. You’ll find a fine array of fresh fish and seafood everywhere, while Portuguese pork and local cheeses are hugely underrated.
              The local house wine will almost certainly be excellent. Local beers and spirits will cost around half the price (and taste pretty
               much the same) as the branded international equivalents.</p>
              <div class="pics">
              <img src="images/snack.jpg" width=600 height="400" alt="CaloVerde"></div>


           <h3>4. Be prepared to walk</h3>
            <p>The Portuguese can be very reluctant to venture far from their vehicles, which is why you’ll see often a roadside lay-by full of
              families picnicking next to their cars. So, you don’t have to walk very far up a track or away from the car park to have the beach,
              woodland or beauty spot completely to yourself. </p>
              <div class="pics">
              <img src="images/street.jpg" width=600 height="400" alt="CaloVerde"></div>

           <h3>5. Don’t assume the starters are free</h3>
            <p>Most Portuguese restaurants will bring you a selection of starters to enjoy while you peruse the menu. These can be as simple as a
              bowl of olives, a basket of bread with butter, local cheeses, tuna or sardine paste, though smarter restaurants may serve prawns,
              crab paté, a variety of sausages, or even a selection of seafood. Don’t assume that these are free – anything you eat will be added
              to your bill. Some menus show a cover charge per person which usually includes bread and butter, others will charge for everything
              individually, even the bread rolls. But don’t get too hung up on this – usually the simple starters are pretty cheap, so if you fancy
              some bread and cheese to start, go for it. Just be aware that anything fishy is usually expensive so only tuck in if you really want it.
              And don’t be afraid to check the price of anything, and say “no thanks” to the waiter if they bring you dishes you don’t want. </p>
