    <p>From the north of Portugal, comes Caldo Verde, the famous Portuguese soup. This is one of the most popular
      soups and Portuguese dishes. While Caldo Verde soup is particularly popular in the winter, you can enjoy it
      all year round, whether it is warm or cold outside. The soup is green in color and made with a particular dark
      green cabbage that is not widely available beyond Portugal’s borders. Substitutes include collard greens or kale.
      Wonderful flavors from the combination of potato puree, slices of chouriço sausage and local Portuguese olive oil,
      complete this delicious and hearty soup. We enjoyed Caldo Verde on several occasions. The soup is simple, full of
      flavor and with delicious textures. If you want to make this soup at home, this simple Caldo Verde recipe will have
      you tasting Portugal in no time.</p>

        <p>Grilled Portuguese sardines or sardinhas asadas is the summertime food of choice in Portugal. In June, the smell of grilled
          sardines infuse the streets of Lisbon for the whole month. That’s when Lisbon hosts the most popular festival dedicated to
          sardines. The Day of Saint Anthony or Santo António Festival celebrates grilled Portuguese sardines on June 12th and 13th.
          From there, the Festas de Sardinha season all other Portugal kicks off, where sardines are celebrated at several Summer
          festivals.Where does the sardine popularity come from? Historically, the Portuguese with the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean
          have relied heavily on seafood for food and commerce. The best time to eat fresh Portuguese sardines is during the peak season between June and
          August. When fresh, sardines are eaten directly from the charcoal grill, marinated with Portuguese olive oil and served with
          salads, rice or potatoes. Simply delicious, this Portuguese dish is a feast for the taste buds.</p>
