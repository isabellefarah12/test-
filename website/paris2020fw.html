        <p><strong>Paris Fashion Week</strong> (French: Semaine de la mode de Paris) is a series of designer presentations
          held biannually in Paris, France with spring/summer and autumn/winter events held each year. Dates are determined by the French Fashion Federation.
          Paris Fashion Week is held at venues throughout the city. In addition to ready-to-wear shows, there are men's and haute couture shows, which are held
          semiannually for the spring/summer and autumn/winter seasons.[2] Also, every year, famous brands like Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, and Céline
          host their shows in historical places such as the Carrousel du Louvre and the Grand Palais.</p>

          <p>Although the first fashion week was held in New York, the event itself derives from "salon shows" ("défilés de mode" in French, literally "fashion parades")
          in Paris couture salons. A fashion week consists of a week of organized events of multiple designer's collections. Before this organized event was recognized in New York City, fashion
          showings were being held in Paris as early as the 1700s. These early showings were only to clients purchasing items and were shown on mannequins.[7] In the 1800s,
          showings began to change. Charles Frederick Worth, noted for haute couture, began showing multiple pieces together and of a higher design. Jeanne Paquin is the first
          designer to make her showings public and Paul Poiret is the first to host parties after his events. In the mid 1800s Mme Pauline von Metternich, an Austrian Princess and wife to the Ambassador of Paris, saw one of Worth's sketches and employed him to make her a gown.
          He gained much recognition through his powerful clients and opened his own haute couture house in Paris in 1858, which sold luxury fashion to upper-class women.</p>

          <p>In 1945 the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture established another set of rules to regulate and determine Haute Couture houses.[10] In order to meet the
            criteria, the house had to ensure they followed the updated rules with one of them being that in each season, a couture house must present a collection of
            at least 35 runs with both daytime and evening wear to the Paris press.[10] Others included having at least 20 members on staff, and that every design
            must include fittings and be made-to-order for the clientele.[10] The following biannual events of Haute Couture houses in accordance with the new guidelines
            set by the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture have been seen as the first pair of fashion weeks in Paris.</p>
